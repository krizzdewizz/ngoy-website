<ngoy-title>Motivation</ngoy-title>
<p>For quite a long time now I'm working as a 'full-stack' developer
	with main emphasis on UI development. We were adopting Angular
	technology from the very early days until now and never regret it. It's
	a perfect fit for our company and also for my private work.
<p>Most of our time we are working on SPAs for mobile/web. Now and
	then we get requirements to implement things like a
	'sign-up confirmation HTML email' or maybe a downloadable, real-time
	Excel XML report. Requirements were for us it is best to go for Java/server-side
	rendering.
<p>And there's the problem: We have to learn/remember two totally
	different rendering engines, syntaxes etc. It's a pain to do exactly
	the same thing, producing HTML, in totally different ways. I wish I had
	reusable components/classes with a well defined API which I could just
	throw in and use.
<p>I wanted to have the Angular experience on the JVM and so ngoy was born.
<p>ngoy is pronounced <span style="font-style: italic">'njoy</span> - enjoy with a silent e.
<p>Angular developers should be familiar with ngoy from the very
	beginning. Binding syntax, components, templates, pipes, services etc.
	are all the same.
<p>The modern SPA concept fits very well into a 'classic' server-side environment.
<p>I know it's nothing really new...like most of todays modern software.
	But it's a fresh look at server-side rendering, which is still heavily
	used in the industrie.
<p>Thank you.
